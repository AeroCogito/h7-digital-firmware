# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance & Standards

### NDAA Section 848 Compliance
This firmware pipeline is designed to meet **NDAA Section 848** (FY2020) requirements:
- ‚úÖ **No covered foreign entities**: Built from official ArduPilot open-source repository
- ‚úÖ **Supply chain transparency**: Complete build provenance via automated GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ **Firmware integrity**: Cryptographically signed with Ed25519 signatures
- ‚úÖ **Secure boot**: Hardware verification prevents unauthorized code execution

### DIU Blue UAS Framework
Compliant with Defense Innovation Unit cybersecurity requirements:
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographic code signing**: Ed25519 algorithm
- ‚úÖ **Secure boot chain**: Bootloader verifies signatures before execution
- ‚úÖ **Build traceability**: Automated pipeline with full audit logs
- ‚úÖ **Update security**: Only signed firmware accepted by bootloader
- ‚úÖ **No binary blobs**: 100% built from auditable open-source

### SLSA Framework Compliance
Meets [**SLSA Level 2**](https://slsa.dev) requirements for supply chain security:
- ‚úÖ **Build provenance**: Machine-readable attestations for every release
- ‚úÖ **Source integrity**: Verifiable link between source code and built artifacts
- ‚úÖ **Build integrity**: Cryptographically signed by GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ **Tamper protection**: Sigstore transparency log prevents post-build modification

## üîê Security Architecture

### Secure Boot Chain
1. **Bootloader** (secure, signature-verified)
   - Contains public key: `keys/AeroCogito_public_key.dat`
   - Verifies firmware signature on every boot
   - Rejects unsigned or tampered firmware
   
2. **Signed Firmware** (signed with private key)
   - Ed25519 signature appended to `.apj` file
   - Signature verified before execution
   - Prevents unauthorized modifications

3. **Update Mechanism**
   - Mission Planner validates `.apj` signature
   - Bootloader performs final verification
   - Rollback protection via secure boot

### Cryptographic Standards

**Firmware Signing (Runtime Security):**
- **Signing Algorithm**: Ed25519 (EdDSA over Curve25519), implemented via Monocypher
- **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256/512 for release checksums
- **Key Length**: 256-bit Ed25519 keys
- **Implementation**: [ArduPilot signing framework](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/Tools/scripts/signing)

**Build Attestation (Supply Chain Security):**
- **Signing Algorithm**: Sigstore (ECDSA P-256)
- **Purpose**: Proves artifact was built by official GitHub Actions workflow
- **Implementation**: [GitHub Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations)

## üîë Signing Key Security

Our firmware signing private key is:
- ‚úÖ Generated offline on air-gapped system
- ‚úÖ Stored as GitHub Secrets (AES-256 encrypted at rest and transmitted over TLS in transit)
- ‚úÖ Never committed to repository
- ‚úÖ Backed up in secure offline cold storage
- ‚úÖ Access limited to authorized security personnel only
- ‚úÖ Key rotation policy: Annual review, rotation on compromise

### Key Management
| Key Type | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Private Key | GitHub Secret (encrypted) | Firmware signing in CI/CD |
| Private Key Backup | Offline Cold Storage | Disaster recovery |
| Public Key | `keys/AeroCogito_public_key.dat` (repo) | Embedded in bootloader |

**Public Key Fingerprint (SHA-256):** 
```
e3:37:0c:eb:9f:e4:78:de:fd:82:ba:a7:79:8c:4e:dc:95:be:3e:3b:95:fd:ca:ac:07:06:22:f2:f6:1b:16:91
```

## üèóÔ∏è Supply Chain Security

### Build Provenance
Every firmware release includes:
- ‚úÖ ArduPilot source commit SHA
- ‚úÖ Build timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflow logs (full audit trail)
- ‚úÖ Toolchain version information
- ‚úÖ SHA-256/512 release checksums
- ‚úÖ Ed25519 digital signature
- ‚úÖ Complete build metadata file
- ‚úÖ **SLSA build attestation** (machine-verifiable provenance)

### Automated Build Pipeline
Our GitHub Actions pipeline ensures:
1. **Source Verification**: Clone from official ArduPilot repository only
2. **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic compilation environment
3. **Isolated Signing**: Private key used only in secure GitHub environment
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logs retained for compliance
5. **Build Attestation**: Metadata file with cryptographic details
6. **SLSA Provenance**: Machine-readable attestation signed by GitHub/Sigstore

### Supply Chain Attack Mitigations
- üîí Dependabot security alerts enabled
- üîí Branch protection rules enforced
- üîí Signed commits required from maintainers
- üîí GitHub Secret access limited to repository administrators
- üîí Security updates monitored via Dependabot

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Verify Firmware Authenticity

**Before installing any firmware, always verify:**

```bash
# 1. Download firmware and checksums
wget https://github.com/AeroCogito/H7-Digital-Flight-Controller/releases/download/[TAG]/arducopter-[TAG]-signed.apj
wget https://github.com/AeroCogito/H7-Digital-Flight-Controller/releases/download/[TAG]/arducopter-[TAG]-SHA256SUMS.txt

# 2. Verify SHA-256 checksum
sha256sum -c arducopter-[TAG]-SHA256SUMS.txt
# Expected output: arducopter-[TAG]-signed.apj: OK

# 3. (Optional) Verify with SHA-512
wget https://github.com/AeroCogito/H7-Digital-Flight-Controller/releases/download/[TAG]/arducopter-[TAG]-SHA512SUMS.txt
sha512sum -c arducopter-[TAG]-SHA512SUMS.txt

# 4. (Optional) Verify public key fingerprint
sha256sum keys/AeroCogito_public_key.dat | awk '{print $1}' | fold -w2 | paste -sd':' -
# Compare with fingerprint above
```

### Advanced Verification - Build Provenance Attestation

For compliance audits and automated verification, we provide [**SLSA build attestations**](https://slsa.dev) signed by GitHub:

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# macOS
brew install gh

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install gh

# Windows
winget install GitHub.cli
```

**Verify attestation:**
```bash
gh attestation verify arducopter-[TAG]-signed.apj --owner AeroCogito
```

This verifies the artifact was built in GitHub Actions from a specific source commit, with an auditable build process, and is cryptographically signed by GitHub/Sigstore (SLSA Level 2 compliance).

### Bootloader Verification
The secure bootloader **automatically verifies** firmware signatures:
- ‚úÖ On every boot
- ‚úÖ Before executing firmware
- ‚úÖ Rejects unsigned/tampered firmware
- ‚úÖ No user intervention required

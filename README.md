## üì¶ Downloads

Get the latest signed firmware from [Releases](../../releases/latest)

### File Types

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `*-signed.apj` | Firmware updates (requires secure bootloader already installed) |
| `*-signed.abin`| Firmware updates via SD Card (requires secure bootloader already installed) |
| `*-with-bootloader-signed.hex` | Complete system (secure bootloader + signed firmware for new installations) |

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Always verify checksums before installing** (see [Verification Guide](docs/VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md))

### Option A: Firmware Update via Mission Planner/QGC

1. Download `arducopter-*-signed.apj` from [Releases](../../releases/latest)
2. Mission Planner ‚Üí Setup ‚Üí Install Firmware ‚Üí Load custom firmware
3. Select downloaded `.apj` file

### Option B: Firmware Update via SD Card

1. Download `arducopter-*-signed.abin` from [Releases](../../releases/latest)
2. **Rename to exactly `ardupilot.abin`** (critical requirement)
3. Copy to SD card root directory (not in any folder)
4. Insert SD card and power cycle board
5. Update completes in ~1 minute (file renamed to `ardupilot-flashed.abin`)

### Option C: Fresh Installation (DFU Mode)

1. Download `arducopter-*-with-bootloader-signed.hex` from [Releases](../../releases/latest)
2. Put board in DFU mode (hold BOOT button while connecting USB)
3. Flash using STM32CubeProgrammer or BetaFlight Configurator
4. Power cycle board

**Detailed instructions:** See [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md)

## üîë Public Key

Firmware signing public key fingerprint ([`keys/FINGERPRINT.txt`](keys/FINGERPRINT.txt)):
```
e3:37:0c:eb:9f:e4:78:de:fd:82:ba:a7:79:8c:4e:dc:95:be:3e:3b:95:fd:ca:ac:07:06:22:f2:f6:1b:16:91
```

The secure bootloader contains this public key and only boots firmware with valid Ed25519 signatures. Full key file: [`keys/AeroCogito_public_key.dat`](keys/AeroCogito_public_key.dat)

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

Automated builds check for new ArduPilot releases daily and produce cryptographically signed firmware with SLSA Level 2 attestations. The secure bootloader (built with embedded public key) verifies Ed25519 signatures before executing firmware.
